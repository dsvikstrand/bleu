# Product Spec (`bleuV1` Direction)

## One-Line Product Promise
`bleuV1` is a source-first app that turns favorite media into bite-sized blueprints, enriched by community insights.

## Core Direction Lock
- Canonical identity lock: `docs/app/core-direction-lock.md`.
- Primary MVP journey: source input -> `My Feed` -> auto channel evaluation/publish.
- Library/inventory routes are compatibility-only and not part of the core user journey.

## Status Snapshot
a1) [have] YouTube to Blueprint generation is live (`/youtube` + `/api/youtube-to-blueprint`).
a2) [have] Public feed/channel/community primitives are live (`/wall`, `/channels`, `/b/:channelSlug`, likes/comments).
a3) [have] `My Feed` personal unfiltered lane is available as `/my-feed` (feature-flagged rollout).
a4) [have] Auto-ingestion from followed YouTube channels is available with auto-only UX and new-uploads-only behavior (no initial old-video prefill).
a5) [have] Auto-channel pipeline contract is implemented for all source paths and can auto-publish to channels after deterministic checks.
a6) [have] Auto-channel assignment supports deterministic mapping and post-artifact LLM labeling (`llm_labeler_v1`) with safe fallback to `general` on invalid output.
a7) [have] Legacy pending/skipped feed rows without blueprints are hidden in `My Feed` UI to reduce migration noise.
a8) [have] `/subscriptions` is simplified for MVP to two visible actions: `Add Subscription` (popup search) and per-row `Unsubscribe`.
a9) [have] `/subscriptions` hides the aggregate ingestion-health summary box to reduce new-user confusion.
a10) [have] Auth-only `Search` route (`/search`) now supports YouTube query discovery with one-click `Generate Blueprint` and `Subscribe Channel`.
a11) [have] `/subscriptions` now supports auth-only YouTube channel search with popup-based subscribe flow (manual paste fallback removed in UI).
a12) [have] Subscription rows now render channel avatar thumbnails (when available) and hide technical status/mode badges from row UI.
a13) [have] `My Feed` blueprint rows now use channel-feed-style visual cards with status-driven auto-channel outcomes.
a14) [have] Manual/search YouTube generation defaults to review+banner enabled for My Feed-bound content.
a15) [have] `My Feed` subscription notice cards now support channel avatar rendering and optional profile-banner background (when available from YouTube).
a16) [have] `My Feed` subscription notice cards open a detailed popup with `Unsubscribe` confirmation; successful unsubscribe removes the notice card.
a17) [have] Manual `Post to Channel` UI is feature-flagged for rollback and removed from normal auto-channel mode surfaces.
a18) [have] `My Feed` blueprint cards now open blueprint detail by card click (dedicated `Open blueprint` link removed).
a19) [have] `My Feed` header now includes direct `Add Subscription` shortcut in addition to `Manage subscriptions`.
a20) [have] Auto-banner queue contract is now available for subscription auto-ingest (`/api/auto-banner/jobs/trigger`) with service-auth control and non-blocking ingestion mode.
a21) [have] Banner-cap policy contract is now available globally with generated banner preservation (`blueprints.banner_generated_url`) and deterministic channel-default fallback.
a22) [have] `My Feed` card footer now shows read-only auto-channel status (`Posted to <Channel>`, `Publishing...`, or `In My Feed`) and uses a unified `Blueprint` badge for blueprint cards.
a23) [have] Search-generated saves now carry source channel context so `My Feed` subtitle row can show channel name instead of duplicated post title.
a24) [have] `My Feed` source subtitle resolution now falls back to source metadata channel title when `source_channel_title` is missing, preventing title duplication for search-generated content.
a25) [have] `/youtube` now runs core generation first and performs review/banner as async post-steps; `Save to My Feed` is non-blocking while enhancements continue.
a26) [have] Banner generation prompt is now explicitly visual-only (no readable text/typography/logos/watermarks) to keep card backgrounds clean.
a27) [have] `/subscriptions` now includes `Refresh` popup flow: scan new videos from active subscriptions, select videos, and start background blueprint generation async.
a28) [have] Manual refresh endpoints now enforce per-user cooldown limits and background-job concurrency guards to prevent duplicate/overlapping runs.
a29) [have] Failed manual refresh videos enter a 6-hour retry cooldown and are temporarily hidden from follow-up scans.
a30) [have] `/subscriptions` now displays lightweight background-generation job status (`Queued/Running/Succeeded/Failed`) with inserted/skipped/failed counts.
a31) [have] Successful manual refresh generation now advances subscription checkpoints forward so those videos are not picked up again by later auto polling.
a32) [have] `/subscriptions` now restores active manual-refresh status on reload via latest user job lookup.
a33) [have] Refresh scan dialog now shows `cooldown_filtered` count for videos hidden by the 6-hour retry window.
a34) [have] Blueprint detail header now prioritizes source-channel attribution for imported YouTube blueprints (creator-only edit CTA removed from default MVP UI).
a35) [have] Subscription details popup in `My Feed` is simplified (relative added-time + unsubscribe only, no absolute timestamp or open-channel action).
a36) [have] `/subscriptions` rows are simplified to channel identity + unsubscribe, with channel-open behavior moved to avatar click and verbose URL/polling text removed.
a37) [have] New profiles now default to `is_public=true` (public by default); existing profile visibility remains unchanged unless edited.
a38) [have] Signed-in top nav is simplified to `Home / Channels / Explore`; Search is now entered via the header `Create` action near the profile menu.
a39) [have] User dropdown includes `Subscriptions` as the direct link to the full subscription management page.
a40) [have] Profile tabs now include owner-only `Subscriptions` with a lightweight list and `Unsubscribe` action.
a41) [have] Core high-traffic copy surfaces (Home/About/Explore/Help/Auth/YouTube/Search/Wall) are aligned to current source-first and auto-channel runtime language.
a42) [have] Landing page hero now uses benefit-first, cold-user language with logged-out primary CTA `Try YouTube URL` and a tertiary `See example blueprint` jump.
a43) [have] Landing now includes an above-the-fold proof card (live example when available, curated example fallback when empty).
a44) [have] Landing social-proof sections (`Top Blueprints`, `Trending Topics`) now show curated fallback content instead of disappearing when live data is empty.
a45) [have] Frontend bootstrap now guards missing Supabase env (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) and shows a user-facing configuration screen instead of a blank page.
a46) [have] Landing use-case strip is now explicit (`fitness`, `recipes`, `study`, `productivity`) to communicate practical value before sign-in.
a47) [have] New-account onboarding now supports an optional first-login `/welcome` setup path for YouTube connect + import.
a48) [have] Onboarding completion requires successful import (`imported_count > 0` or `reactivated_count > 0`); connect-only does not complete setup.
a49) [have] Home now shows a small dismissible YouTube-setup reminder card for skipped/incomplete onboarding users.
a50) [have] Source Pages foundation is active: YouTube channels are now represented as platform-agnostic shared source entities with route `/s/:platform/:externalId`.
a51) [have] Subscription surfaces now deep-link to Source Pages, while legacy `/api/source-subscriptions*` contracts remain active for compatibility.
a52) [have] Source page reads now lazily hydrate missing avatar/banner assets for legacy backfilled rows, so first open can populate visuals without requiring re-subscribe.
a53) [have] Source pages now expose a public, deduped blueprint feed (`latest + load more`) via `GET /api/source-pages/:platform/:externalId/blueprints`, and `/s/:platform/:externalId` renders Home-style read-only blueprint cards.
a54) [have] Source pages now include an auth-only `Video Library` section for back-catalog generation (`GET /videos`, `POST /videos/generate`) with async queue execution and duplicate skip visibility.

## Core Model
b1) `Source Item`
- Media object from an adapter (YouTube v1).
- Canonical identity key (example: `youtube_video_id`) for dedupe/cache.

b2) `Imported Blueprint` (primary content type)
- Generated step-by-step blueprint from a source item.
- Includes source provenance and generation metadata.

b3) `User Insight/Remix` (secondary content type)
- User-added value layered on an imported blueprint.
- Not a standalone free-form post type in `bleuV1` MVP.

b4) Feed surfaces
- `My Feed`: personal timeline for all imported items and auto-channel outcomes.
- `Home` (`/wall`): shared lane with voting/comments and auto-published items that pass checks.

b5) Subscription behavior (MVP simplified)
- UI behavior is auto-only.
- On subscribe, backend sets a checkpoint (`last_seen_published_at` / `last_seen_video_id`) without ingesting historical uploads.
- Future uploads after checkpoint ingest directly to `my_feed_published`.
- Auto-ingested subscription items run review generation by default.
- Banner generation for auto-ingest is controlled by `SUBSCRIPTION_AUTO_BANNER_MODE`:
  - `off` (default): no auto banner worker activity.
  - `async` (target): queue background banner jobs with no ingestion blocking.
  - `sync` (ops/debug): generate in-line (higher latency).
- A persistent notice card is inserted into `My Feed` with state `subscription_notice`.
- Notice cards are visualized with channel avatar and optional banner background when metadata is available.
- API compatibility note: `mode` is accepted on subscription endpoints but coerced/treated as `auto`.
- Manual refresh reliability policy:
  - `refresh-scan` rate limit: 1 request per 30 seconds per user.
  - `refresh-generate` rate limit: 1 request per 120 seconds per user.
  - max selected items per generation run: `20`.
  - successful generation updates per-subscription checkpoint (`last_seen_published_at` / `last_seen_video_id`) forward.
  - if generation fails for a selected video, that `(subscription_id, video_id)` is hidden from scan results for `6h` and then automatically retryable.

## MVP Lifecycle Contract
c1) Pull/ingest -> generate blueprint -> publish to `My Feed`.
c2) Optional user remix/insight.
c3) Auto-channel pipeline runs per item (classifier mode is env-driven: deterministic or post-artifact LLM labeler).
c4) Channel gate contract remains (`channel_fit`, `quality`, `safety`, `pii`); in `llm_labeler_v1`, channel-fit is pass-by-design for the selected label while quality/safety/pii stay enforced.
c5) Result:
- pass -> publish to Home feed (`/wall`)
- fail/warn/block -> remain in `My Feed` (personal-only)
c6) Legacy manual candidate endpoints remain behind rollback controls and are not primary UI flow.
c7) Subscription notice flow:
- successful subscribe/reactivate inserts one persistent notice card per user/channel.
- notice canonical key: `subscription:youtube:<channel_id>`.
- notice cards are informational and have no Accept/Skip or channel submit controls.
- notice cards open details on click and include `Unsubscribe` with confirm; unsubscribe removes the notice card from My Feed for that user/channel.

## Product Principles
p1) Source-first content supply (not creator-first posting).
p2) Personal-first ownership (`My Feed` is always available).
p3) Community adds interpretation/opinion via insights/remixes.
p4) Channel cleanliness enforced by explicit gates.
p5) Explainable in one sentence.

## MVP Default Policies (Lock)
m1) Adapter scope default: YouTube-only.
m2) My Feed default visibility: personal/private lane until channel promotion.
m3) Channel promotion default mode: automatic publish to classifier-resolved channel after checks (default env mode is still `deterministic_v1`).
m4) User contribution default: insights/remixes attached to imported blueprints (no standalone free-form posting in MVP core).
m5) Non-pass auto-channel outcomes default action: blocked from channel, retained in My Feed.
m6) Evaluator default mode: all-gates-run with aggregated decision evidence.
m7) Planned mutable interfaces use explicit auth scope + idempotency mode and unified response envelope.
m8) Runtime default for legacy manual gates remains `CHANNEL_GATES_MODE=bypass`; auto-channel path can enforce independently via `AUTO_CHANNEL_GATE_MODE`.

## Primary User Flows (`bleuV1`)
f1) User follows YouTube channels from `/subscriptions` by clicking `Add Subscription`, searching channels, and clicking `Subscribe`.
f2) User can unsubscribe from active channels directly on `/subscriptions` (unsubscribed rows disappear from the page list).
f3) User enters search/create via header `Create` (which routes to `/search`) and gets transient YouTube suggestions (not persisted yet).
f4) User selects `Generate Blueprint` on a result to generate and save directly into `My Feed`.
f5) User can subscribe to a result’s channel from the same search card.
f6) On subscribe/reactivate, user gets one subscription notice card and future uploads ingest automatically into `My Feed`.
f7) Auto-channel pipeline publishes eligible items automatically and labels My Feed cards with posted channel outcomes.
f8) User scans, remixes, and adds insights.
f9) Eligible items are promoted to Home feed channels after gates.
f10) Community votes/comments to surface higher-value items.
f11) User can manually refresh subscriptions from `/subscriptions`, preview new videos, and launch async background generation without blocking app usage.
f12) New accounts can optionally complete source setup at `/welcome` before normal usage.

## Scope Boundaries (MVP)
s1) In scope
- YouTube adapter as first and only required adapter.
- Personal feed from pulled media.
- Channel publish gating and moderation-lite rules.
- Community interactions on shared blueprints (likes/comments).

s2) Out of scope
- Multi-adapter rollout in same MVP cut.
- Sync/reactivate user controls in `/subscriptions` are deferred (future “sync specific videos” flow).
- Debug simulation UI exposure remains deferred (operator-only endpoint stays hidden from user UI).
- Fully open free-form blog/social posting model.
- Full moderation platform for user-generated channels.

## Next Milestone (Hardening)
n1) Keep legacy manual gate behavior stable with `CHANNEL_GATES_MODE=bypass` while auto-channel path uses `AUTO_CHANNEL_GATE_MODE`.
n2) Iterate YouTube search discovery flow before introducing multi-adapter search.
n3) Harden ingestion reliability visibility (polling freshness + latest job checks) before adding more subscription features.
n4) Roll out `SUBSCRIPTION_AUTO_BANNER_MODE=async` in production after channel defaults are seeded.
n5) Reserve `enforce` mode for non-prod verification until dedicated rollout approval.
