# Execution Plans Registry

This file is the authoritative active/completed registry for execution plans.

## Active

  Active manual iterative build plan for the remaining MVP work.
- `docs/exec-plans/active/bleuv1-manual-iteration-scheme.md`
  Step-by-step execution scheme with per-step completion tracking (plan -> PA -> implement -> evaluate).
- `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
  Deferred work backlog and non-blocking engineering debt.

## Current Program Snapshot
- Legacy channels-first program: completed/archived.
- `bleuV1` source-first program: active.
- `bleuV1` MVP build execution: manual iterative mode.
- Agentic orchestration: paused reference path.

## Rules
- Keep only truly active docs in `active/`.
- Move finished project plans into `completed/`.
- Update this index whenever status changes.
