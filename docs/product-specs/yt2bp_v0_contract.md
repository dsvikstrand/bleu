# YT2BP v0 Contract

## Scope
- Endpoint: `POST /api/youtube-to-blueprint`
- Version: `v0`
- Stability rule: v0 changes must be additive or versioned.
- 2026-02-12 note: Project 2 Step 1 feed-summary hygiene changes are UI-only and do not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-12 note: Project 2 Step 2 feed-row shell changes are UI-only and do not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-12 note: Project 2 one-row full-tag rendering changes are UI-only and do not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-12 note: Project 2 one-row tag measurement hotfix is UI-only and does not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-13 note: Project 2 Step 3 wall-to-wall shell tightening and Wall/Explore comment counters are UI-only and do not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-13 note: Explore tag-click lookup hotfix (search-first behavior on feed cards) is UI-only and does not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-13 note: Project 3 Step 1 channel join-state UI wiring and filter-only chip behavior are frontend-only and do not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-13 note: Channels IA/routing phase (`/channels`, `/b/:channelSlug`, curated slug guards, `/tags` redirect) is UI-only and does not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-13 note: Channel-scoped `+ Create` flow routes to `/youtube?channel=<slug>&intent=post` and blocks public publish unless channel is valid and joined; this is UI/product behavior and does not alter this endpoint contract.
- 2026-02-13 note: App-wide wall-to-wall layout migration (Run 1) updates YouTube page framing to a minimal document-like layout; UI-only and does not alter this contract.
- 2026-02-17 note: dual-feed rollout moved post-generation behavior to personal-first (`/my-feed`); this does not alter the YT2BP request/response envelope.
- 2026-02-17 note: optional AI review/banner are now executed as separate post-generation steps in UI (`/api/analyze-blueprint` and `/api/generate-banner`) so core YT2BP latency is lower; this does not alter the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: subscription ingestion (`/api/source-subscriptions*`, `/api/ingestion/jobs/trigger`) and pending-card accept/skip (`/api/my-feed/items/:id/accept|skip`) are separate flows and do not alter this endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: subscription create path now uses auto-only behavior (incoming `mode` is compatibility-only and treated as `auto`); first subscribe sets checkpoint and inserts a `subscription_notice` feed card. This remains outside this endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: debug simulation endpoint (`/api/debug/subscriptions/:id/simulate-new-uploads`) is env-gated (`ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS`) and service-auth only (`x-service-token`, no user bearer required); this also remains outside the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: YouTube subscription channel resolution now includes `browseId` fallback parsing for handle pages where direct `channelId` metadata is unavailable.
- 2026-02-17 note: ingestion reliability visibility adds service-auth endpoint `GET /api/ingestion/jobs/latest`; this is an ops path and does not alter the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-17 note: auth-only YouTube discovery endpoint `GET /api/youtube-search` is additive and does not alter the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-17 note: auth-only YouTube channel discovery endpoint `GET /api/youtube-channel-search` is additive and does not alter the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-17 note: `GET /api/source-subscriptions` now includes optional `source_channel_avatar_url` read-time enrichment for UI; this remains outside the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-17 note: subscription auto-ingest generation now enables review-by-default while keeping banner disabled; this remains outside the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: subscription notice cards may use `source_items.metadata.channel_banner_url`, and unsubscribe now removes user-scoped notice rows from My Feed; this remains outside the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: async auto-banner queue endpoints (`/api/auto-banner/jobs/trigger`, `/api/auto-banner/jobs/latest`) and cap fallback policy are additive ops paths and remain outside the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: Search->YouTube route handoff now includes channel context (`channel_id`, `channel_title`, `channel_url`) so save-to-feed can persist source channel metadata; YT2BP endpoint envelope remains unchanged.
- 2026-02-18 note: save-to-feed now preserves channel-title metadata across source upserts so My Feed subtitle mapping stays stable; YT2BP endpoint envelope remains unchanged.
- 2026-02-18 note: `/youtube` UI now forces core endpoint calls with `generate_review=false` and `generate_banner=false`; toggles run async post-steps and attach results after save when available.
- 2026-02-18 note: endpoint timeout is now env-configurable via `YT2BP_CORE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `120000`, bounded server-side).
- 2026-02-18 note: banner prompt hardening now enforces visual-only imagery and explicitly blocks readable text/typography/logos/watermarks in generated backgrounds.
- 2026-02-18 note: subscription manual-refresh endpoints (`/api/source-subscriptions/refresh-scan`, `/api/source-subscriptions/refresh-generate`) are additive and do not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: refresh hardening (`GET /api/ingestion/jobs/:id`, refresh endpoint rate caps, `MAX_ITEMS_EXCEEDED`, `JOB_ALREADY_RUNNING`, failed-video cooldown via `refresh_video_attempts`) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: refresh hardening follow-up (`GET /api/ingestion/jobs/latest-mine`, manual-refresh checkpoint-forward updates, cooldown-filter visibility) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: auto-channel publish endpoint (`POST /api/my-feed/items/:id/auto-publish`) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: auto-channel publish now uses deterministic real-channel classification (tag+alias mapper with `general` fallback) and may return additive classifier metadata (`classifier_mode`, `classifier_reason`); this remains outside the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: auto-channel classifier now also supports `llm_labeler_v1` (artifact-only sync label pass, retry once on invalid output, fallback to `general`) and may return additive `classifier_confidence`; still outside this endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: profile workspace feed endpoint (`GET /api/profile/:userId/feed`) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-18 note: high-traffic wording harmonization (`Home`, `Create`, auto-publish phrasing) is UI-only and does not alter this endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: YouTube OAuth connect/import endpoints (`/api/youtube/connection/*`, `/api/youtube/subscriptions/*`) are additive onboarding paths and do not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: optional first-login onboarding route (`/welcome`) and onboarding-state table (`user_youtube_onboarding`) are additive product surfaces and do not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: `/api/youtube/subscriptions/import` now may mark onboarding complete after successful import, which is outside the YT2BP request/response envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: Source Pages foundation (`source_pages` table + `/api/source-pages/:platform/:externalId` subscribe/read endpoints + `source_page_id` linkage on subscriptions/source_items) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: source-page read-path lazy asset hydration (backfilled avatar/banner fill on `GET /api/source-pages/...`) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: source-page public feed endpoint (`GET /api/source-pages/:platform/:externalId/blueprints`, deduped + cursor-paginated) is additive and does not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: source-page video-library endpoints (`GET /api/source-pages/:platform/:externalId/videos`, `POST /api/source-pages/:platform/:externalId/videos/generate`) are additive and do not alter the YT2BP endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: source-page video-library listing now supports `kind=full|shorts` with shorts threshold `<=60s`; additive and outside the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-19 note: source-page video-library list now uses dual rate-limit guards (burst+sustained) and frontend cache/focus-refetch tuning; additive and outside the YT2BP envelope.
- 2026-02-20 note: source-page unlock endpoint (`POST /api/source-pages/:platform/:externalId/videos/unlock`) is additive; legacy `/videos/generate` remains compatibility alias; both are outside this endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-20 note: refill-credit wallet model (`user_credit_wallets`, `credit_ledger`, `/api/credits` refill fields) is additive and outside this endpoint envelope.
- 2026-02-20 note: subscription new-upload ingest now writes unlockable feed rows (`my_feed_unlockable`) before generation; this lifecycle change is outside this endpoint envelope.

### Request constraints
- Single YouTube clip only (`youtube.com/watch` or `youtu.be`).
- Playlist URLs are rejected.

## Current non-goals
- Playlist support.
- Multi-video merge.
- Instruction-security runtime checks (`llm_instruction_security_v0` is planned only).
- Contract-breaking schema changes.
- Direct channel publication from YT2BP call path.
